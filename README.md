Just a repository for my #100DaysofCode

I'm new to programming. I studied basic Java for a semester at school. Then recently,
learnt the basics of Python, in about a week. Most of my programs will be basic, and
probably full of mistakes. I'd appreciate any feedback on the programs, I'm new and
looking to improve my skills, not flaunt them.
